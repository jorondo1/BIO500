	abstract = {Despite its recognized importance for understanding the evolution of animal sociality as well as for conservation, long term analysis of social networks of animal populations is still relatively uncommon. We investigated social network dynamics in males of a gregarious mountain ungulate (Alpine ibex, Capra ibex) over ten years focusing on groups, sub-groups and individuals, exploring the dynamics of sociality over different scales. Despite the social structure changing between seasons, the Alpine ibex population was highly cohesive: fission–fusion dynamics lead almost every male in the population to associate with each other male at least once. Nevertheless, we found that male Alpine ibex showed preferential associations that were maintained across seasons and years. Age seemed to be the most important factor driving preferential associations while other characteristics, such as social status, appeared less crucial. We also found that centrality measures were influenced by age and were also related to individual physical condition. The multi-scale and long-term frame of our study helped us show that ecological constrains, such as resource availability, may play a role in shaping associations in a gregarious species, but they cannot solely explain sociality and preferential association that are likely also to be driven by life-history linked physiological and social needs. Our results highlight the importance of long-term studies based on individually recognizable subjects to help us build on our understanding of the evolution of animal sociality.},

	abstract = {Recently, ecology has shown a strong interest in network theory. The question, as with any other emerging field, is to what extent we are making real progress in understanding ecological and evolutionary processes or just telling the same stories with fancy new words. I first present a biased overview of the development of network theory, focusing on its search for common patterns across seemingly different systems. I then proceed by discussing some applications of network theory in ecology, namely, species interactions, spatial ecology, epidemiology, and evolution in social groups . Finally, I suggest important contributions of the network approach such as identifying the consequences of heterogeneity for population and community dynamics, potential pitfalls, and future directions.
Zusammenfassung
In jüngerer Zeit hat die Ökologie ein starkes Interesse an der Netzwerktheorie gezeigt. Wie bei jedem neu auftauchenden Feld stellt sich die Frage, in welchem Maße wir echte Fortschritte im Verständnis ökologischer und evolutionärer Prozesse machen oder nur dieselben alten Geschichten mit neuen Phantasiebegriffen erzählen. Ich beginne mit einem nicht unparteiischen Überblick über die Entwicklung der Netzwerktheorie, wobei ich mich besonders auf ihre Suche nach den gemeinsamen Mustern von scheinbar unähnlichen Systemen konzentriere. Ich diskutiere dann einige Anwendungen der Netzwerktheorie in der Ökologie, namentlich die Interaktionen zwischen Arten, räumliche Ökologie, Epidemiologie und Evolution in sozialen Gruppen. Schließlich weise ich hin auf bedeutende Beiträge des Netzwerkansatzes, wie die Identifizierung der Folgen von Heterogenität für Populations- und Gemeinschaftsdynamik, auf mögliche Fallstricke und zukünftige Entwicklungsrichtungen.},

	abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such as communities – through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Speciﬁcally, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the signiﬁcance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},
